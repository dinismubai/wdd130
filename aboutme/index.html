       <p>Hello there. I am from Mozambique. I am studying computer and web development. I've liked computers since I can remember
         and I've always wanted to know how do they operate. I did study computer science at university and currently I am working 
         as a Business Analyst. It has been amazing and I do believe that learning in BYU can help me improve my skills and do better.
       </p>
       <p>I am married to a wonderful woman with whom I have two wonderful sons. My family is the best thing I have and it is by far
           the greates gift that I could ever wish for.
       </p>
       <p>
         I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Later Days Saints since 2007 and I served as a full time missionary from 2014 to 
         2016 in the Lisbon Portugal Mission. I love that country and I do want to go back and serve there once again.
       </p>
       <p>
         When I have some free time, I do like reading books, play music on my guitar and watch animes. I am excited to be a BYU student 
         and I want to make a good use of my time here, learning and getting to know new people.
